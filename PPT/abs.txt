Physicians and health policy makers are required to make predictions during their decision making in various medical problems. Many advances have been made in predictive modelling toward outcome prediction, but these innovations target an average patient and are insufficiently adjustable for individual patients. One developing idea in this field is individualised predictive analytics based on patient similarity. The goal of this approach is to identify patients who are similar to an index patient and derive insights from the records of similar patients to provide personalised predictions.We propose the use of vector-based word embedding models to learn a cross-conceptual representation of medical vocabulary. The learned model is dense and encodes useful knowledge from the training concepts.perform optical character recognition and take the text and convert the unstructured data into a structured data and pass it through co-sine  similarity algorithm where the model will predict the output and make the patient to know about the disease. so based on the disease we could direct the patient to the best hospital.
