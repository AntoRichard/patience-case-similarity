The increasing use of digital patient records in hospital saves time and re- duces risks of wrong treatments caused by lack of information. Digital patient re- cords also enable efficient spread and transfer of experience gained from diagnosis and treatment of individual patient which is now-a-days mostly manual (speaking with colleagues) and rarely aided by computerised system. Most of the content in patient records is semi-structured textual information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid textual case-based reasoning system promoting experience reuse. This is de- rived from structured or unstructured patient records, case-based reasoning and similarity measurement based on cosine similarity metric improved by a domain specific ontology and the nearest neighbour method. As a result, hospital staffs can learn not only new cases but also add comments to existing cases and thus enables prototypical cases.
